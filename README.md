Project is a very basic text rpg game engine. It uses QT as a base for its GUI. It is very simple and basic for now but the underlying structure to build upon is there.

Move all files to a folder and open the project file in QT.

Run the project through QT to play.

If there is an error related to "Placeholder Text" open the location of the error and delete the lines which throw it up.
